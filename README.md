Sign-up Page:
The sign-up page is where the user can sign up with personal information: email, password, height, weight, age, and preference list, including but not limited to gender, activity level, gym access, and fitness goal. These are used to calculate personalized calorie targets and burn goals via the Harris-Benedict formula.

All the fields should be filled in to ensure all the calculations and data are correct. Information is pushed into the database after it has been validated. If successfully registered, the user is taken to the login page; otherwise, it displays an error message if the account already exists.

The page dynamically handles selections via radio buttons and does calorie calculations based on the user's goals, having different multipliers for weight loss or muscle gain, or to maintain weight. Error handling ensures that when there are missing fields or already-created accounts, it provides a response with clarity
